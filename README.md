This command displays a quick reference list of common pyenv operations, helping you quickly review and use various pyenv features.

### Setting up in .zshrc

To make the pyenv-cheat command available every time you open a new terminal window, you can add it to your .zshrc file:

1. Open the .zshrc file:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. Add the following line at the end of the file:
   ```bash
   alias pyenv-cheat='path/to/pyenv-cheat-script'
   ```
   Replace 'path/to/pyenv-cheat-script' with the actual path to the script.

3. Save and close the file.

4. Reload the .zshrc file:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

Now you can use the pyenv-cheat command in any terminal window.
